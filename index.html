        <h2 class="ingr">Ingredients:</h2>
        <p><strong>All pizza dough starts with the same basic ingredients: flour, yeast, water, salt, and olive oil.</strong></p>
        <h2>Recipe :</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Make the dough: </strong>Mix the dough ingredients together by hand or use a hand-held or stand mixer. Do this in steps as described in the written recipe below.</li>
          <li><strong>Knead: </strong>Knead by hand or with your mixer. I like doing this by hand.</li>
          <li><strong>Rise: </strong>Place dough into a greased mixing bowl, cover tightly, and set aside to rise for about 90 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
          <li><strong>Punch & shape: </strong>Punch down risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide in 2. Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle. Cover and rest as you prep the pizza toppings.</li>
          <li><strong>Top it: </strong>Top with favorite pizza toppings.</li>
          <li><strong>Bake: </strong>Bake pizza at a very high temperature for only about 15 minutes.</li>
